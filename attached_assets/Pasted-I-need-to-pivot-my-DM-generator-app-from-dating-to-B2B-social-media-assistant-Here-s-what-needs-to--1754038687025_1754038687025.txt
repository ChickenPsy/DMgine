I need to pivot my DM generator app from dating to B2B social media assistant. Here's what needs to change:

CURRENT STATE: My app is at dmgine.com - it generates personalized DMs with multiple tones, has user auth, and tier-based pricing.

PIVOT GOAL: Rebrand as "Social Media Assistant for Small Business Owners"

CHANGES NEEDED:

1. HOMEPAGE REDESIGN:
- New headline: "Stop Spending Hours Crafting the Perfect Business DM"
- Subheading: "Your AI social media assistant writes professional outreach messages in seconds - so you can focus on running your business"
- Replace dating/personal references with business use cases

2. USE CASES SECTION:
Replace current examples with:
- Influencer partnership outreach
- Customer follow-up messages  
- Brand collaboration requests
- Professional responses to reviews/comments
- Cold outreach to potential clients
- Thank you messages to customers

3. TONE OPTIONS:
Rename existing tones to be business-focused:
- Professional (formal business communication)
- Friendly (warm but professional)
- Enthusiastic (excited about partnerships)
- Direct (straight to the point)
- Appreciative (thank you messages)
Keep the premium tones but rebrand them appropriately

4. PRICING PAGE:
Update to business tiers:
- Starter: $19/month (50 messages) - "Perfect for solo entrepreneurs"
- Professional: $49/month (200 messages) - "Ideal for small teams"  
- Agency: $99/month (unlimited) - "For marketing agencies"

5. COPY CHANGES:
- Replace "target person" with "recipient" or "contact"
- Change "DM" references to "messages" or "outreach"
- Add business-focused placeholder text
- Update meta descriptions and titles for SEO

6. ADD TESTIMONIAL PLACEHOLDERS:
- "Saves me 2 hours a week on social media outreach" - Local Restaurant Owner
- "My influencer partnerships increased 40% with better initial messages" - Boutique Owner
- "Finally sound professional when reaching out to potential clients" - Consultant

Keep all existing functionality (auth, payments, AI generation) but rebrand the interface and copy for B2B use.

Make sure the core app logic stays the same - just changing the presentation layer to target small business owners instead of dating.
