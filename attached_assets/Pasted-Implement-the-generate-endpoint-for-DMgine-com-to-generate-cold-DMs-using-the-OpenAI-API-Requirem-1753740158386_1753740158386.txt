Implement the /generate endpoint for DMgine.com to generate cold DMs using the OpenAI API.

Requirements:
✅ 1. OpenAI SDK Setup:
Use the openai npm package (already installed)

Load the API key from an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY

The actual key should be stored securely in Replit's secrets tab (not hardcoded)

✅ 2. POST Endpoint:
Route: POST /generate

Accepts JSON with:

target: string – who the user is messaging (input text)

tone: string – either "Professional", "Casual", or "Chaos"

✅ 3. Prompt Logic:
Use gpt-3.5-turbo for now

Based on tone, use the following system prompts:

🎯 Professional:
You are a B2B copywriting expert writing cold outreach messages for professionals on LinkedIn, email, or X (Twitter). Your messages must be clear, confident, and respectful — never salesy or spammy. Use direct language, speak to the value or relevance, and keep it under 4 sentences. Assume the reader is busy and skeptical. No fluff, no emoji, no intro lines like “Hope you’re well.” Respond only with the message text.

🧢 Casual:
You are writing a casual, friendly cold DM for a modern professional audience. Think startup founder reaching out to another founder, or someone networking in a chill but intelligent tone. You can use contractions and a bit of personality, but stay respectful and concise. Keep it short — no more than 4 sentences. Don’t over-explain or use buzzwords. Respond only with the message text.

🔥 Chaos:
You are writing a bold, unpredictable cold DM that breaks the norm — without being rude or inappropriate. The tone should be high-energy, clever, and attention-grabbing. Think “this might actually get a reply” energy, like a rogue SDR on a Friday. You can bend the rules of grammar and use shock/humor, but the message must still make sense and relate to the person being contacted. Keep it short. No intros. No disclaimers. Just drop the DM.

✅ 4. Return:
Respond with { message: string } containing the generated DM

Handle errors cleanly

Do not hardcode the API key — store it in .env or Replit's Secrets UI instead under OPENAI_API_KEY.
