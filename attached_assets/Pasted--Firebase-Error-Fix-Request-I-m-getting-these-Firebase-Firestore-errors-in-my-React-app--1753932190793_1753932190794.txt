# Firebase Error Fix Request

I'm getting these Firebase/Firestore errors in my React app:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
Firestore (12.0.0): WebChannelConnection RPC 'Listen' stream 0x76ce9202 transport errored. Name: undefined Message: undefined
```

## Current Issues:
1. Multiple 400 status responses from Firestore endpoints
2. WebChannelConnection RPC 'Listen' stream errors with "undefined" messages
3. Transport errors when trying to connect to Firestore

## What I need you to fix:

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Check if my `.env` file has all required Firebase variables
- Create/update `.env` with proper VITE_FIREBASE_* variables
- Make sure VITE_FIREBASE_USE_EMULATOR is set to false for production

### 2. Firebase Configuration Issues
- Fix the Firebase initialization in my `lib/firebase.ts` file
- Remove problematic emulator connection logic that might be causing transport errors
- Add better error handling for Firestore operations
- Fix any auth state management issues

### 3. Firestore Security Rules
- Check if my Firestore rules are properly configured for authenticated users
- Make sure users can read/write their own documents in the `users` collection

### 4. Code Improvements Needed:
- Better error handling for network issues
- Remove any problematic retry logic that might cause WebChannel errors
- Simplify Firestore operations to prevent transport errors
- Add proper logging to debug connection issues

## Files that likely need attention:
- `lib/firebase.ts` (main Firebase config)
- `.env` (environment variables)
- Firestore security rules (in Firebase Console)
- Any auth state management code

## Expected Outcome:
- No more 400 errors from Firestore
- No more WebChannelConnection transport errors  
- Smooth authentication and Firestore operations
- Proper error messages instead of "undefined" errors

Please review my Firebase setup and fix these connection/transport issues. Focus on making the Firebase connection stable and removing any problematic network code that's causing the WebChannel errors.
