Problem Description
The account creation process in DMgine is experiencing an infinite "Creating account" loading state, even though accounts are being successfully created in Firebase. Users see console errors and the UI never resolves to a success state.
Observed Issues

Infinite Loading State: Create Account button shows endless "Creating account" text
UI State Management: Frontend doesn't properly handle async Firebase Auth responses
Console Errors: Multiple JavaScript errors visible in browser dev tools
Race Conditions: Possible multiple simultaneous account creation requests
No Success Feedback: Users don't know their account was actually created

Required Fixes
1. Account Creation Component

Add proper loading state management with timeout handling
Implement request deduplication to prevent multiple submissions
Add comprehensive error handling for all Firebase Auth error cases
Include success state that redirects user or shows confirmation

2. Error Handling

Catch and properly display Firebase Auth errors (email already exists, weak password, etc.)
Add user-friendly error messages instead of console-only errors
Implement retry mechanism for transient failures

3. UI/UX Improvements

Add loading spinner with proper states (loading, success, error)
Implement form validation before submission
Add timeout mechanism (e.g., 10 seconds) that shows error if no response
Clear form and show success message when account is created

4. State Management

Ensure loading states are properly reset after completion
Prevent form resubmission during account creation process
Add proper cleanup on component unmount

Code Structure to Review
Please examine and fix the following areas:

Account creation form component and its state management
Firebase Auth integration and error handling
Form submission logic and async operation handling
Loading states and user feedback mechanisms
Console error sources and resolution

Expected Behavior After Fix

User fills out account creation form
Clicks "Create Account" - button shows loading state
Firebase processes the request
On success: User sees confirmation and is redirected/signed in
On error: User sees clear error message and can retry
No console errors or infinite loading states
